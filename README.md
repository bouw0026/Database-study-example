## ðŸŽ“ Key Terminology

| Term                      | Definition                                                                 | MySQL Implementation Example                                                                 | College Example        |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| **Strong Entity**         | Independent objects that can exist on their own                           | `CREATE TABLE Students (id INT PRIMARY KEY, ...);`                                          | `Students` table      |
| **Weak Entity**           | Depends on a strong entity for existence                                  | `CREATE TABLE Enrollment (id INT, student_id INT, PRIMARY KEY(id, student_id), FOREIGN KEY...);` | `Enrollment` records  |
| **Primary Key (PK)**      | Uniquely identifies each record in a table                                | `student_id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY`                                                             | 9-digit student ID    |
| **Foreign Key (FK)**      | Establishes relationship between tables by referencing another table's PK  | `FOREIGN KEY (course_code) REFERENCES Courses(course_code)`                                 | Course prerequisites  |
| **1NF (First Normal Form)** | Eliminates repeating groups, ensures atomic values                      | `-- Bad: courses_taken CSV column`<br>`-- Good: Separate Enrollment table`                  | Split CSV course lists|
| **2NF (Second Normal Form)** | Removes partial dependencies (all non-key attributes depend on entire PK) | `-- Move program_name from Students to Programs table`                                      | Program requirements  |
| **3NF (Third Normal Form)**  | Removes transitive dependencies (non-key attributes don't depend on other non-key attributes) | `-- Extract dean information to Departments table`                              | Department structure  |
| **Index**                 | Improves query performance on specific columns                            | `CREATE INDEX idx_student_email ON Students(email);`                                        | Faster login queries  |
| **Transaction**           | A sequence of operations performed as a single logical unit               | `START TRANSACTION;`<br>`UPDATE Accounts...;`<br>`INSERT Transactions...;`<br>`COMMIT;`     | Course registration   |
| **ACID Properties**       | Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability for transactions            | `SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;`                                             | Grade updates         |
| **Stored Procedure**      | Precompiled collection of SQL statements                                  | ```<br>CREATE PROCEDURE RegisterStudent(<br>    IN sid INT,<br>    IN ccode CHAR(7)<br>)<br>BEGIN... END;<br>``` | Enrollment system     |
| **Trigger**               | Automatic action invoked when specific events occur                       | ```<br>CREATE TRIGGER validate_email<br>BEFORE INSERT ON Students<br>FOR EACH ROW<br>BEGIN... END;<br>``` | Email validation      |
| **View**                  | Virtual table based on the result-set of a SQL query                      | `CREATE VIEW Active_Students AS`<br>`SELECT * FROM Students WHERE status = 'Active';`       | Current semester list |
| **Partitioning**          | Splitting tables into smaller, more manageable pieces                     | `PARTITION BY RANGE (YEAR(enrollment_date))`                                                | Archive old records   |
| **Normalization**         | Process of organizing data to minimize redundancy                         | `-- 3NF implementation separating Students, Programs, Departments`                          | Academic structure    |
| **Denormalization**       | Intentional duplication for performance optimization                      | `-- Add calculated GPA column to Students table`                                            | Student dashboards    |
| **ER Diagram**            | Visual representation of entities and relationships                       | Generated by tools like MySQL Workbench or `mermaid-js`                                     | Course prerequisites  |
| **Composite Key**         | Primary key consisting of multiple columns                                | `PRIMARY KEY (student_id, course_code, semester)`                                           | Enrollment records    |
| **Referential Integrity** | Ensures relationships between tables remain consistent                    | `FOREIGN KEY... ON DELETE CASCADE`                                                          | Student withdrawals   |
